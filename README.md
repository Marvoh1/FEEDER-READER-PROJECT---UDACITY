# FEEDER READER PROJECT - By Marvin Mugo

## Project Overview
This project is part of FrontEnd Web Development Nanodegree at Udacity -  School of Programming.

## Summary

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, 
they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! 
Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left 
with an application with an incomplete test suite.

## How will this help my career?
Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality. 

## Expected Suite Tests

Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
Write a new test suite named "The menu".
Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".
Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".
Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
No test should be dependent on the results of another.
Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
When complete - all of your tests should pass.

## Built In:

- Html
- CSS
